## Technical Decisions

### Language: TypeScript
**Rationale**:
- MCP SDK maturity
- Type safety for API contracts
- Good async support
- Wide developer adoption

### Architecture: Modular
**Benefits**:
- Easy to add new devices
- Community contributions
- Plugin system ready
- Clear separation of concerns

### Testing: Comprehensive
**Approach**:
- TDD for core functionality
- Mock ASCOM responses
- Real device validation
- Performance benchmarks

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- [ ] 100% ASCOM Alpaca API coverage
- [ ] <100ms tool response time
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in v1.0

### Community
- [ ] 50+ GitHub stars in first month
- [ ] 5+ contributors
- [ ] 3+ real user testimonials
- [ ] 1+ integration with popular software

### Impact
- [ ] First MCP for scientific equipment
- [ ] Enable new AI astronomy workflows
- [ ] Bridge AI and astronomy communities
- [ ] Foundation for future extensions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **ASCOM Compliance**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with simulators
   - Validation with multiple device types

2. **Performance Issues**
