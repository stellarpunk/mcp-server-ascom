# ASCOM MCP Bridge Research

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive research on ASCOM (Astronomy Common Object Model) standards to inform the design of an MCP (Model Context Protocol) bridge that will enable AI-powered control of astronomical equipment.

## Research Goals

1. **Understand ASCOM Architecture** - Platform evolution, device types, and API specifications
2. **Analyze Community Needs** - Pain points, feature requests, and adoption patterns
3. **Design MCP Bridge** - Create a bridge that respects ASCOM standards while enabling AI control
4. **Enable Innovation** - Add AI-driven features that enhance astronomical observations

## Key Research Questions

1. **Technical Architecture**
   - How does ASCOM Alpaca work?
   - What are the device types and their APIs?
   - How is device discovery handled?
   - What are the async patterns?

2. **Community & Adoption**
   - Who maintains ASCOM?
   - What software uses ASCOM?
   - What are common pain points?
   - How can we contribute?

3. **MCP Integration**
   - How to map ASCOM devices to MCP tools?
   - What AI enhancements can we add?
   - How to ensure compatibility?
   - What's our value proposition?

## Research Standards

- **Citations Required**: Every fact must have a source
- **Confidence Levels**: Mark as High/Medium/Low/Inference
- **Distinguish Facts from Interpretation**: Be clear about what's documented vs inferred
- **Cross-Reference**: Validate information from multiple sources

## Strategic Vision

Create the first MCP server for astronomical equipment that:
- Works with any ASCOM-compatible device
- Enables natural language telescope control
- Adds AI-driven observation planning
- Integrates with SpatialLM for sky mapping
- Respects existing ASCOM standards
