# ASCOM MCP Bridge - Executive Summary

## Project Vision

Create the **first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for astronomical equipment**, enabling AI assistants to control any ASCOM-compatible telescope, camera, or observatory device through natural language.

## Key Findings from Research

### 1. Market Opportunity
- **No existing MCP servers** for scientific equipment control
- **ASCOM Alpaca** provides universal HTTP/REST API for astronomy devices
- **5,000+ active ASCOM users** in forums, 100+ GitHub projects
- Growing demand for **remote observatory control**

### 2. Technical Feasibility
- ASCOM Alpaca's REST API maps cleanly to MCP tools
- Existing TypeScript MCP SDK provides solid foundation
- Device discovery via Management API enables plug-and-play
- Seestar findings show 65ms latency is acceptable

### 3. Community Alignment
- ASCOM is **open source** with MIT-style licensing
- Community values **interoperability** and standards
- Active development with Platform 7 supporting cross-platform
- Pain points we can address: discovery, documentation, AI integration

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture
```
AI Assistant ↔ MCP Protocol ↔ ASCOM MCP Server ↔ Alpaca API ↔ Any Device
```

### Core Value Propositions

1. **For AI Users**
   - "Hey Claude, photograph the Orion Nebula"
   - Natural language astronomy
   - Intelligent observation planning
   - Automated imaging sequences

2. **For Astronomers**
   - Works with existing equipment
   - No driver changes needed  
   - Adds AI assistance capabilities
   - Maintains full manual control

3. **For Developers**
   - Clean API for astronomy apps
   - TypeScript/modern tooling
   - Extensible plugin system
   - Well-documented

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- MCP server infrastructure
- ASCOM Alpaca client library
- Device discovery system

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 4-6)
- Telescope control (goto, tracking)
- Camera control (capture, download)
- Focus control (position, autofocus)

### Phase 3: AI Enhancements (Weeks 7-9)
- Natural language targets
- Observation planning
- Image quality analysis
- Weather decisions

### Phase 4: Release (Weeks 10-12)
- Documentation
- Community beta testing
- Launch campaign

## Unique Differentiators

1. **First astronomy MCP** - Pioneer in the space
2. **Universal compatibility** - Any ASCOM device works
3. **AI-native design** - Built for LLM interaction
4. **Zero modification** - Uses existing drivers
5. **Open source** - Community-driven development

## Success Metrics

- **Technical**: 100% API coverage, <100ms response time
- **Adoption**: 50+ stars, 5+ contributors in month 1
- **Impact**: Enable new AI astronomy workflows
- **Quality**: 95% test coverage, zero critical bugs

## Strategic Benefits for Seestar ALP

1. **Immediate Integration** - Seestar already supports ASCOM
2. **Broader Ecosystem** - Connect with any astronomy device
3. **AI Leadership** - First to enable AI control
4. **Community Growth** - Attract AI developers to astronomy
5. **Future-Proof** - Ready for next generation of tools

## Next Steps

1. **Create `ascom-mcp-server` repository**
2. **Build MVP with telescope control**
3. **Test with Seestar and simulators**
4. **Engage ASCOM community early**
5. **Document everything thoroughly**

## Call to Action

This project positions us at the intersection of two growing communities:
- **AI/LLM developers** seeking real-world applications
- **Astronomers** wanting easier equipment control

By building this bridge, we enable entirely new ways of exploring the cosmos through the combination of artificial and human intelligence.
