# Next Session Notes

## v0.4.0 Summary
Successfully implemented IoT device patterns:
- âœ… Direct connection strings (no discovery required)
- âœ… Smart device resolution from multiple sources
- âœ… Fixed async/await errors with alpyca
- âœ… Added comprehensive integration tests
- âœ… Updated all CLAUDE.md files

## High Priority for Next Session

### 1. Test with Real Seestar âœ… READY
- âœ… Turned off simulator mode in seestar_alp
- âœ… Created REAL_SEESTAR_TESTING.md guide
- âœ… Created test_v0.4_direct_connection.py script
- âœ… Created .env.real_seestar configuration
- ðŸ”„ Test v0.4.0 connection patterns with real hardware
- ðŸ”„ Verify event stream handling works

### 2. Complete Event Stream Integration
- Foundation is in `seestar_event_handler.py`
- Need to integrate with device manager
- Handle concurrent commands and events

### 3. Session-Based Tools
Create high-level observation tools:
- `start_observation_session(location, equipment)`
- `observe_target(name, duration, filters)`
- `end_observation_session()`

## Technical Debt

### Clean Up
- Remove redundant MCP docs after Seestar testing
- Fix deprecation warnings in device manager (datetime.utcnow)
- Consider removing manager_direct.py and manager_fast.py if created

### Testing
- Ensure integration tests work with real simulator
- Add more event stream tests
- Test device state persistence edge cases

## Architecture Next Steps

### 1. Stellarium Integration
- Research Stellarium remote control protocol
- Add `stellarium_sync()` tool
- Enable visual telescope control

### 2. Natural Language Targets
- Integrate with celestial databases
- Add fuzzy matching for object names
- Support "that bright star near..."

### 3. Multi-Device Coordination
- Support multiple telescopes
- Coordinate observations
- Load balancing for imaging

## Key Patterns Established

### IoT Device Lifecycle
```
First time: Discover â†’ Save state
Daily use: Load state â†’ Connect directly
```

### Connection Methods
1. Direct: `seestar@host:port`
2. Environment: `telescope_1` from ASCOM_DIRECT_DEVICES
3. Persistent: Previously discovered devices
4. Config: Known devices in config

### Error Handling
Helpful messages that guide users to solutions, not just report problems.

## Documentation Status
- âœ… Root CLAUDE.md updated for v0.4.0
- âœ… tests/CLAUDE.md includes integration tests
- âœ… MCP Configuration Guide reflects new patterns
- âœ… README shows instant connection examples

## Remember
- No automatic discovery!
- Alpyca methods are synchronous (not async)
- Test with real hardware next
- Focus on user experience
