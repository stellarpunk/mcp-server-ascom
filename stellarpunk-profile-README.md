# Stellarpunk ⚙️✨

> Where brass meets binary, steam meets stars

## The Stellarpunk Movement

We're building the future of astronomy with a retrofuturistic twist. Imagine Victorian-era telescopes controlled by neural networks, brass gears interfacing with quantum computers, and steam-powered observatories automated by AI.

**Stellarpunk** is about:
- 🔭 **Open source astronomy tools** that bridge the physical and digital
- ⚡ **AI-powered telescope control** with a steampunk aesthetic
- 🌌 **Community-driven innovation** in astronomical software
- 🎩 **Retrofuturistic design** meets cutting-edge technology

## Our Projects

### 🔧 [mcp-server-ascom](https://github.com/stellarpunk/mcp-server-ascom)
Control ASCOM-compatible telescopes through AI assistants. The brass gears of astronomy meet the neural networks of tomorrow.

*"In the stellarpunk future, every telescope is a time machine - brass eyepieces gazing through silicon sensors, steam-powered mounts guided by machine learning, and copper wires carrying starlight to quantum processors."*
