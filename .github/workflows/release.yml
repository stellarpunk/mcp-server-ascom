# This workflow is replaced by ci-cd.yml which provides:
# - Better testing before release
# - Test PyPI validation
# - Post-release verification
# 
# To release:
# 1. Push to main branch (triggers tests)
# 2. Create and push a tag: git tag v0.2.4 && git push --tags
# 3. CI/CD will automatically:
#    - Run all tests
#    - Build packages
#    - Upload to Test PyPI
#    - Test installation
#    - Upload to PyPI
#    - Create GitHub release
#    - Verify final package works
